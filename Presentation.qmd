# Introduction

- **Paper**: *"To Explain or To Predict?"*
- **Author**: Galit Shmueli
- **Published**: Statistical Science, 2010
- **Key Idea**: Differentiating between **explanatory modeling** (understanding data relationships) and **predictive modeling** (forecasting future outcomes).

---

# Explanatory vs. Predictive Modeling

### Explanatory Modeling

- **Goal**: Understand causal relationships within data.
- **Approach**: Uses theories and hypotheses about data-generating processes.
- **Evaluation**: Focuses on goodness-of-fit, parameter significance, and theoretical validity.

### Predictive Modeling

- **Goal**: Accurately predict future or unseen data.
- **Approach**: Prioritizes performance over theoretical understanding.
- **Evaluation**: Focuses on prediction accuracy and error rates (e.g., RMSE, MAE).

# Explanatory vs. Predictive Modeling

- Explanatory models aim to understand relationships and uncover causal mechanisms and are based on statistical significance, effect sizes, goodness of fit
- Predictive models prioritize maximizing out of sample predictive accuracy and are assessed using out of sample predictive accuracy measures

---

# Why Does This Distinction Matter?

- **Different Requirements**: Models for explanation and prediction require different design, validation, and interpretation.
- **Common Misconceptions**: Explanatory models often assumed to predict, but they may fail at that task.
- **Risk of Misinterpretation**: Incorrectly applying explanatory models for prediction can lead to faulty decisions.

# Example: Health Research

- **Explanatory**: Studying factors influencing heart disease (e.g., diet, lifestyle) to understand causation.
- **Predictive**: Using patient data to predict who is likely to develop heart disease, regardless of causation.

**Takeaway**: The insights needed for prevention policies vs. medical forecasting differ significantly.

# Modeling and Validation Differences

### Explanatory Models

- **Statistical Tests**: P-values, confidence intervals.
- **Fit Metrics**: R-squared, adjusted R-squared.
- **Focus**: Interpretable coefficients.

### Predictive Models

- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, RMSE, AUC.
- **Cross-validation**: Training and testing on separate datasets.
- **Focus**: Out-of-sample prediction accuracy.

# Implications for Data Science

- **Increasing Use of Predictive Models**: As data science grows, predictive models are becoming more popular in traditionally explanatory fields.
- **Importance of Purpose-Driven Modeling**: Misalignment between model goals and applications can lead to significant real-world errors.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Incorrect model application can have societal consequences (e.g., in policy or healthcare).

# Practical Takeaways

1. **Clarify Goals**: Define whether the goal is to explain or predict before modeling.
2. **Choose Models Accordingly**: Select model types, validation, and evaluation criteria based on the goal.
3. **Avoid Misuse**: Be cautious of applying explanatory models for prediction, and vice versa.
4. **Communicate Assumptions**: Clearly state assumptions and limitations, especially if using a model outside its intended purpose.

# Conclusion

- **Main Message**: "To Explain or To Predict?" urges practitioners to consciously distinguish between explanatory and predictive goals.
- **Shmueliâ€™s Contribution**: Emphasizes the importance of matching model types to their specific goals, and the consequences of ignoring this distinction.
- **Enduring Relevance**: Shmueli's insights continue to guide best practices in data science, helping prevent misuse of models.
